1. Section 2.4, page52, Question 1
(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small. This suggests that our training data has too few degrees-of-freedom, and this is more likely because we used a more inflexible statistical learning method.
(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the sample size n is small. This suggests that our training data has too many degrees-of-freedom, and this is more likely because we used a more flexible statistical learning method.
(c) The relationship between the predictors and the response is highly non-linear. This suggests our linear regression model has too many degrees-of-freedom, and this is more likely because we used a more flexible statistical learning method.
(d) The variance of the error terms is extremely high. This suggests that our model might be overfitting the training data, and the model is often result from a more flexible statistical learning method.
