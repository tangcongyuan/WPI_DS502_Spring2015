(a)




(b) Explanation: 
Test Error = Bias + Variance + Bayes Error;
Training Error monotonously decrease as flexibility increases;
Bayes Error is irreducible and constant due to our measuring method;
Bias and Variance have trade-off effect that as the flexibility increases, Bias decreases and Variance increases.
